/*
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.
Abstraction is the process of separating ideas from their action.
Interfaces are like skeletons. If you want to build a human, you should use that skeleton.
Abstract classes are like skeletons, but with some meat on them as well. It's just there to make your work easier.
You can consider an abstract class to be an interface, which already has some implementation.

You do abstraction when deciding what to implement.
You do encapsulation when hiding something that you have implemented.

Interfaces simply create a kind of structure for your classes to denote that your class should have a defined and agree-upon structure.
For example, all animals eat and make sounds. Thus, you can have an interface,
called IAnimal which only mentions that classes should Eat, and MakeSound.

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects
(to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body.
 The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

 An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods.
