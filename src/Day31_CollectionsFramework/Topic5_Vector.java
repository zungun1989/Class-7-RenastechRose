        /*
            In Java, ArrayList and Vector are almost the same.
            Vector is thread-safe, ArrayList is not.
            This means whenever we want to perform some operation on vectors,
            the Vector class automatically applies a lock to that operation.
            So at the same time, someone else can not change the value too.
            It is because when one thread is accessing a vector, and at the same time another thread tries to access it,
            an exception called "ConcurrentModificationException" is generated.

            Note:  If thread safety is not important
            It is recommended to use ArrayList instead of Vector because vectors less efficient.
